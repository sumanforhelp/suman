Provinces of nepal
province 1: province 2: province 3: province 4: province 5: province 6: province 7
Province 3 is named as Bagmati ; Provice 4 is named as Gandaki ; likewise province 6 and 7 are named as karnali and sudurpaschim pradesh
But still province 1,2 and 5 are still anonymous. Hopefully we will have names soon. 
I live and work in province 3 i.e Bagmati province. It is also capital of Nepal. It has population approximately of 4 million.
